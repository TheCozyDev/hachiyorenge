     git clone https://github.com/TheCozyDev/hachiyorenge
     ```

2. **Open project in Android Studio**  
   - Launch Android Studio.  
   - Select **File > Open** and navigate to the project's folder.  
   - Click **OK** to open the project.

3. **Run the project**  
   - Wait for the project to sync and build (Gradle sync may take some time).  
   - Ensure a device or emulator is connected.

That's it! The app should now be running. 

## Note

Since the previous owner of the project seems to have abandoned it, I decided to fix the app myself.
I am not an expert programmer nor do I have any knowledge in Kotlin or Android Programming but I really
liked the app and wanted to fix the Lyrics tab that was crashing the app when searching for the lyrics.
